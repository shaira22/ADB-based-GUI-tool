# ADB-based-GUI-tool

Some specific objectives and requirements like enhancing efficiency and accuracy were considered for designing the automated testing tool. The primary goals of the tool were to automate the execution of test cases and provide a user-friendly interface to ensure comprehensive logging for analysis and debugging. The tool was designed to meet the needs of the testers of the company by simplifying the testing process and providing adequate support for various testing scenarios.
